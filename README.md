# AstroLogistics
Work assignment system based on vector and tool requirement.
Registering work for orbital robots similar to land and sea logistics will require a rebuild of traditional routing systems to account for coordinate systems and distances differences. Work assignment to available machines with matching capability for the job will require a system to quickly estimate nearest celestial neighbor and then determine navigation paths for final comparison.

1. Coordinate system converter
2. Orbit system trajectory calculator
3. Orbit system registry
4. Orbit state vector cache
